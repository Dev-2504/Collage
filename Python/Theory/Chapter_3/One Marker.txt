1. What is PyLab?
--> PyLab is a module in matplotlib used for plotting and numerical operations.

2. Which function is used to draw a line graph in PyLab?
--> plot()

3. Which function is used to show the graph?
--> show()

4. Which function is used to set the title of a graph?
--> title("...")

5. Which function is used to label the X-axis?
--> xlabel("...")

6. Which function is used to label the Y-axis?
--> ylabel("...")

7. Which function is used to draw a bar graph?
--> bar()

8. What is the use of legend() in PyLab?
--> It displays labels for different data series in a graph.

9. What is the Fibonacci series?
--> A series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

10. Write the first five terms of the Fibonacci sequence.
--> 0, 1, 1, 2, 3

11. What is dynamic programming?
--> A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing results.

12. What is the 0/1 Knapsack problem?
--> A problem in which you choose items with given weights and values to maximize value within a weight limit.

13. Which algorithm technique does Knapsack problem use?
--> Dynamic Programming

14. What is Divide and Conquer?
--> A technique where a problem is divided into smaller subproblems, solved individually, and combined.

15. Name a common algorithm that uses Divide and Conquer.
--> Merge Sort

16. Which PyLab function is used to save a plot as an image?
--> savefig("filename.png")

17. What is the use of grid(True) in PyLab?
--> It displays a grid on the graph.

18. Which PyLab function is used to plot multiple data series?
--> Use multiple plot() calls before show()

19. What does xlim() do in PyLab?
--> Sets the limit of the X-axis.

20. What does ylim() do in PyLab?
--> Sets the limit of the Y-axis.

21. What is mortgage plotting used for?
--> To visualize payments over time with interest rates.

22. What is the difference between line graph and bar graph?
--> Line graph shows trends; bar graph compares quantities.

23. What is recursion?
--> A function calling itself to solve smaller subproblems.

24. Why is dynamic programming better than recursion in some cases?
--> Because it stores results and avoids repeated work.

25. What is overlapping subproblem property?
--> Same subproblems are solved multiple times in recursion (avoided in DP).

26. What is optimal substructure property?
--> An optimal solution can be formed from optimal solutions of subproblems.

--> hist()

28. What is the output of plot([1,2,3], [4,5,6])?
--> A line graph with points (1,4), (2,5), (3,6)

29. Which Python library includes PyLab?
--> matplotlib

30. What is the default color of a plot line in PyLab?
--> Blue
