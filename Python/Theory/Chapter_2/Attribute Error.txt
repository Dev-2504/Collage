--> Definition : An AttributeError occurs in Python when you try to access or call an attribute (like a variable or method) that does not exist for that object.

    --> It happens when you use dot notation (object.attribute) and the attribute is not defined.
    --> Very common mistake when calling methods or accessing properties that are misspelled or missing.
    --> Useful for debugging when working with classes, objects, and external libraries.

--> Example : 

    class Student:
        def __init__(self, name):
            self.name = name

    s1 = Student("Dev")
    print(s1.age)  # age attribute not defined → AttributeError

--> Output : 

    AttributeError: 'Student' object has no attribute 'age'
