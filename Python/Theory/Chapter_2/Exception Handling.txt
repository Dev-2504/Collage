Definition : Exception handling in Python is the process of managing errors (called exceptions) that occur while a program is running.
         --> Instead of crashing the program, Python lets you catch the error and respond properly using try, except, and other keywords.

Important Keywords in Exception Handling :

    try : Block where you write code that may cause an exception (error).

    except : Block that runs if an exception occurs in the try block.

    else : Runs if no exception occurs in the try block.

    finally : Block that always runs, whether exception occurred or not.

    raise : 	Used to manually raise an exception.


Syntax : 

    try:
    # risky code
except ExceptionType:
    # handling code
else:
    # runs if no error
finally:
    # always runs


Example : 

def divide(a, b):
    try:
        result = a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Cannot divide by zero.")
    else:
        print("Result is:", result)
    finally:
        print("Execution completed.")

# Call the function
divide(10, 2)
divide(5, 0)

Output : 

Result is: 5.0
Execution completed.
Error: Cannot divide by zero.
Execution completed.
