--> Definition : A ValueError occurs in Python when a function receives the right data type but the wrong value, which cannot be processed.

    --> Happens when the value is not suitable for the operation.
    --> Data type is correct, but the content of the value is invalid.
    --> Common in type conversions like int(), float() when the value cannot be converted.

--> Example : 

    num = int("hello")  # trying to convert string to int

--> Output : 

    ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'hello'
