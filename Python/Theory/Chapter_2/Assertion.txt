--> Definition : An assertion is a way to test if a condition in your program is True.
             --> If the condition is False, the program will stop and raise an AssertionError.
             --> It is mostly used for debugging and validating assumptions in code.

--> assert — This is the keyword used for assertion in Python.

--> 1. Used for debugging:
    --> Helps to catch bugs early by checking if conditions are met.

--> 2. Stops program on failure:
    --> If the condition is false, Python stops running and shows an error.

--> 3. Can include error message:
    --> You can add a custom message to explain the reason for the failure.

--> Syntax : 

    assert condition, "optional error message"

--> Example :

    age = 18
    assert age >= 18, "Age must be at least 18"
    print("You are eligible.")

--> Output : 

    You are eligible.

age = 15

AssertionError: Age must be at least 18
