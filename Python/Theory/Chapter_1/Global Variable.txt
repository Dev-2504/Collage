------------------------------------------

---> Definition :- A global variable in Python is a variable that is declared outside of all functions and is accessible from   anywhere in the program — both inside and outside of functions.
     --> It has a global scope, meaning it can be used in any part of the code.
     --> Declared outside any function
     --> Can be accessed inside functions
     --> To modify a global variable inside a function, you must use the global keyword


--> Example :-
    
    x = 10  # Global variable

    def show():
        print("Value of x is:", x)

    show()
    print("Outside function, x is:", x)


--> Output :-

    Value of x is: 10  
    Outside function, x is: 10
