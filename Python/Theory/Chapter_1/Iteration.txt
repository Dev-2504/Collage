---> Definition :- Iteration means repeating a set of instructions again and again. In Python, we use loops to do iteration.



--> Types of Iteration in Python:

--> for loop

--> while loop



--> for loop :-
    --> Definition :- A for loop in Python is used to repeat a block of code for each item in a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range).
    --> It is used when we know how many times we want to repeat something.

    --> Example:-

    for i in range(5):
        print(i)


--> while loop :-
    --> Definition :- A while loop in Python is used to repeat a block of code as long as a given condition is true.
    --> It keeps running the code inside the loop until the condition becomes false.

    --> Example:-

    count = 1

    while count <= 5:
        print("Count is:", count)
        count += 1
