------------------------------------------

---> Definition :- A tuple in Python is a collection of items that is ordered and unchangeable (immutable).
     --> It is used to store multiple values in a single variable, just like a list, but you cannot change the items after the tuple is created.
     --> Tuples are written using round brackets: ( )
     --> Items are indexed, starting from 0
     --> Tuples can contain different data types
     --> Tuples are faster than lists and are used when data should not change


--> Example :-
    
    my_tuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
    print(my_tuple)  # Output: banana
